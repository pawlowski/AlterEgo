AlterEgo Bugzilla extension

==Setup==

Run checksetup.pl, it will import all the words into the bugzilla db and add aliases to all bugs in the database.

Need to:

* load words from the word files into the db during init (doesn't work right now)
* only add new words that are not already in the db
* add alteregos to bugs that don't have one

* Display alterego in bug editing page
* Display alterego in bug list pages
* add alterego when creating a new bug
* allow lookup of bugs using alterego
* check for duplicate alteregos during checksetup
