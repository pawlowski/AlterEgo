AlterEgo Bugzilla extension

==Setup==

Run checksetup.pl, it will import all the words into the bugzilla db and add aliases to all bugs in the database.

Need to:

* Display alterego in bug editing page
* Display alterego in bug list pages
* add alterego when creating a new bug
* allow lookup of bugs using alterego
* check for duplicate alteregos during checksetup

Done:

* load words from the word files into the db during init
* only add new words that are not already in the db
* add alteregos to bugs that don't have one

Desired traits of words (exceptions occur for all of them):

* Two syllables
* Seven or fewer letters
* Non-technical
* Non-exotic: very simple English words that everyone will be familiar with
* Visual or physical meaning: evokes a visual memory in the reader/listener
* Easy to pronounce
* No homophones (other words that sound the same but are spelled differently)
* Familiar, simple meanings that non-native English speakers would know
* Not hard to pronounce by non-native English speakers
